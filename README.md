Basketball League Web App using React, Express, MangoDB

Currently in research stage

Step 1: Decides what stacks will be used. At the moment, for Frontend React & Redux with Bootstrap 4 will be used. For Backend, Node, Express, MangoDB.

Do the research on similar react app using login functionalitiy.


At first, I need to set up database structure. And using mock up tools like Sketch/Balsamiq Mockups I can do prototyping and planning out what I should do next.

After some research there will be limitation on using mangoDB as a main database. It should be more schemed well before starting this work.
